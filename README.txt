Known Bugs: Pressing a fourth key, while three are already held down results in the fourth key not being logged as a keypress.
Spamming some player actions causes the sprite to lag behind. (specifically spamming attack causes some weird stuff until you move again)

Our team used Trello for project management, Photoshop/GIMP for spritesheet creation, and Discord for communication.
