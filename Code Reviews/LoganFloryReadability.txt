Sprint #2
Name of .cs being reviewed: KeyboardController.cs
Author of .cs being reviewed: Jerry Qiu
Minutes taken to complete: 15
Specific Comments:
- The chunks of code are organized in ways that make sense.
- The variable names use two different naming schemes (camelCase and PascalCase)
- Variable names are self documenting
- The dictionaries are a really good way to organize the keyboard commands
- Comments help me read through conditionals and loops
- There are big chunks of things commented out that are kinda confusing
