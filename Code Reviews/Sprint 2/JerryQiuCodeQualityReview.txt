Code looks good. Class isn't too long and doesn't depend on too many things. There are a few hard coded values for variables but those look fine and are obvious what they are for.

Class looks like it has all the stuff required for sprint 2 implementation.

Recommended changes: the source rectangle variable seems unnecessary. just put frames into a list and have a int keep track of what frame to draw.
