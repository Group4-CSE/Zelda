Sprint number: 2
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: TrapEnemy.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Tyler Liu

Specific comments on code quality:
Code has a lot of variables, and uses very few magic numbers. Nice!
Sprite could potentially be seperated and stored as a variable, but the class isnt overtly long.
Notes about what will be updated for future sprints make sense and are thoughtful.
The random generation seems like a relic from previous enemies, doesnt actually appear to be relevant to trap.
sourceRect could probably be set at the beginning since the trap is not animated.
Attack is currently not set up, we need to remember to add this when we do collision.
max health is hard coded. it would probably be better to set this as a constant.
enemyVel is not actually used for movement.
certain variables are never used.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
If we wanted to make the trap larger or smaller then we could easily adjust width and height.
Velocity appears to be hard coded, so we cant easily change that without refactoring.
