Specific comments on code quality:
Great use of Dictionaries and Lists to organize the key mappings between the Key 
and movement of Player, Items, Blocks, and Projectiles. In the contructor, all 
initializations and definitions were separated and self readible, which is nice.
One thing that I did notice, however, is the use of deeply nested if-else statements. 
In the future, it may cuase problems, but since I know what this code is doing, its
quite easy to maintain. The use of dictionary for commands and keys are a great touch
as we can always add new keys or commands base on what we would like to add in the
future. Some code were also commented out. It may be good to delete it entirely, 
if it isn't useful. In the adjustCurDirec, you could set the magic number 5 as a
constant? Should'nt really impact anything too much. 


A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
If we wanted to add new commands and key mappings, it definitely doable by adding it to the dictionary and the list.
