Specific comments:
The large bunch of variables at the top is a bit much, could probably do with some comments.
The constructor makes it very clear what is happening and why things are being initialized.
the move code for randomly determining movement could probably use some commenting explaining what is happening.
The takeDamage and draw method are both very well self documenting
All methods are self explanatory
