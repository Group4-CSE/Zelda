Sprint #2
Name of .cs being reviewed: AquamentusEnemy.cs
Author of .cs being reviewed: Noah Hufnagel
Minutes taken to complete: 
Specific Comments: 15
- Variables declared and defined at top make for less refactoring
- Good layering allows more efficient changing of the class as a whole since 
  methods like Attack are offloaded to the player class
- Draw is difficult to read and would be difficult for other people to maintain
- spawnFireBalls is a good helper method and makes the class more modular
Hypothetical Change:
- Like all of our classes, if we wanted to alter the spritesheet in any way almost,
  this class would require a lot of refactoring since the rectangles use magic numbers
  and are specific to one spritesheet. This could be a bit easier if / when we separate
  drawing from the enemy class(es).
