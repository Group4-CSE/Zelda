Specific comments:
Methods are well-named and/or well-commented
top of the class is muddled - what's going on with that constructor?
Declares a boolean variable, which actually helps readibility. It's generally not great coding practice, but it makes it more clear what you're talking about.)
comments explain what still needs to be added
playerRect = player.getDestRect(); is commented out and then coded in two lines below. Small thing obviously.
