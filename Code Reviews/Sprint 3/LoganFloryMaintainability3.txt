Sprint #2
Name of .cs being reviewed:GameManager.cs
Author of .cs being reviewed: Jerry Qiu
Minutes taken to complete: 20
Specific Comments:
- Lack of comments make some parts of it harder to read and could make it harder for other people to maintain code
- Splitting this class into a lot of methods makes it a lot easier to target problems if/when they arise
- The order of the parameters for the detectCollision methods are sometimes in different order and could make things confusing, maybe
  adding a comment / key for each detect collision could help with this?
- The use of class scope variables makes things a lot easier to update / refactor
Hypothetical Change:
- Overall, to me, this would be an extremely easy class to maintain. The only problems I can think of is if we were to make some sort
  of radical change, like if we stopped using a dictionary spritesheet for some reason. If we did add more content to the game it would
  be easy as just adding the corresponding method calls and declarations as the rest.
