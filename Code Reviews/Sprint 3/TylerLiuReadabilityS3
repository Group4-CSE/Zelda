Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

- Good use of variable naming, helps reader understand what the var stores without looking at documentation. (Self Explanatory)
- The flow/logic within each function allows readers to visualize what is happening. For example, in RoomLoading():
    a. Initialize list of required blocks, enemies, items, background, walls, and coordinates.
    b. load from the file
    c. create/return new room
- Comment that describes what the directory should look like is great for letting reader know what to expect.
- To us we understand what each switch statement is doing, but maybe to other readers it might be difficult. (Bit more comments maybe)
- This file is quite large compared to other files. (315 lines) But, I think its alright since the loadFromFile has switch cases that 
calls all of the add functions.
