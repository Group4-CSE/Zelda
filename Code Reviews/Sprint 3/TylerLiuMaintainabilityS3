Specific comments on code quality:
Overall from first look, the collisions detector and handler in this class looks clean and no code smell.
Great use of using the refactored getDestRect() method for blocks and using the intersect method
on enemies. I also noticed how there are no magic numbers and all variables are consice and self
explanatory. The for each loops to loop through comparisons of each block and enemy is also clever. 
Something I would change however, is the if statement in the detectCollision. The shorthand is great
,but it makes it diffcult to maintain and read for future reference. THe handler also takes advantage 
of the enemy X, Y property for adjustment. 


A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current
implementation could or could not easily support that change:

This class involves enemy and block collisions. If we want to add blocks that could damages enemies, it
would be doable. In foreach loop, we would need to define which type of block harms enemies, then in the 
handler, we call the deal damage function on the enemies.
