Sprint number: 3
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: PlayerEnemyCollision.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Tyler Liu

Specific comments on code quality:
using intersect is called twice, could just be used once.
Enemy size using .toArray allows enemies to be removed dynamically
code seems to be relatively robust, shouldnt have too many issues with maintainability. 
the directional attack code could cause some problems since it depends pretty heavily on player

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
If we wanted to change the size of a player or the enemy then the code would still work perfectly because of getDestRect.
If the player was changed and getDirection returned different values then the attacking check would not also need to be refactored
