Sprint #4
Name of .cs being reviewed: TrapEnemy.cs
Author of .cs being reviewed: Logan Flory
Minutes taken to complete: 15


Specific Comments:
- Splitting out isInLine was a good move
- Good avoiding of magic numbers
- more of a concision vs readibility thing, but using if (true) then (set boolean true) is always a bit visually clunky, though perhaps less so with these long statements
- good to keep the takedamage method around in case we decide it ever may take damage

Hypothetical change:
- if we were to change how the trap moves - ie add more than just 4 directions - than it could get clunky to have switch statements for every directions.
- would be better then to have like a vector-based movement
