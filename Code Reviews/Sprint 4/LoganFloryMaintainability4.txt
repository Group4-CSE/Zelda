Sprint #4
Name of .cs being reviewed: RoomLoader.cs
Author of .cs being reviewed: Noah Hufnagel
Minutes taken to complete: 15
Specific Comments:
- Lot of helper methods make it easier to make broader changes
- The beginning of loadFromFile may not work on some machines but I'm not fully sure
- Variables mostly named accordingly
- loadFromFile is very easy to add more sections to if we wanted to parse more
- Some of the values are not well defined / named
- The use of screenX / blockSizeMod is really smart and would allow us to easily upscale blocks
Hypothetical Change:
- So the way adding enemies / other entities works is fine and would even be easy to maintain
on a small scale, but if we upscaled a large amount and wanted to add say 50 enemies, it would be a LOT
of cases in 1 switch statement, so a hypothetical change would to be to potentially make a method
that replaces the switch statement in all of these adder methods
