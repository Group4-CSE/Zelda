Sprint number: 4
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: CaveDoor.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Jerry Qiu

Specific comments on code quality:
Overall from first look, the cave door class looks clean and no code smell.
Its pretty short but concise to where it executes well
Good use of switch case to determine what position (Direction) the door should face
wheb creating or loading a room.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current
implementation could or could not easily support that change:

This class involves the loading and placement of door. If we wanted to create a special way to access a door,
it would be doable with this class. There are two more other doors (Locked & Closed) that
are really similar to the cave door. It would be easy to set new paramenters or new ways to unlock/access
doors if we wanted to add a hidden room.
