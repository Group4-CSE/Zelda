Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
- Good use of variable naming, helps reader understand what the var stores without looking at documentation. (Self Explanatory)
- Separation of different variable initialization help organize and see what each section of the code does what
- One problem I noticed is the use of magic numbers
- Good use of for-loop to create the HUD
- Logic of player health as it relates to hearts is pretty clean and cool
