Specific Comments:
- Variables are mostly named accordingly
- Comments help read some things like the enum
- The order of some thingsd is really weird, like why is there an EPCol declared on 73?
- The use of the enum makes the if else statements a lot easier to process
- Lots of methods make the methods higher level, lot of offloading makes easier to skim
- Order of methods is a little weird to me but doesn't affect too much
