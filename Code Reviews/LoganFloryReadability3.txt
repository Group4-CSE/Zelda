Specific Comments:
- The use of a direction variable helps make the if else to determine direction less convoluted 
- Comments walk through code clearly
- Variables are named appropriately and are self defining
- Not sure why there is an empty constructor 
- Could have maybe used helper methods to shorten playerEnemyHandler
