Sprint number: 5
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: ESpawner.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Tyler Liu

Specific comments on code quality:
overall this class is quite easy to maintain.
You can change how long it takes to spawn enemies relatively easily.
easy to enable and disable.
all variables make sense and most constants can just be changed at the top
personally I would reccomend making spawning Time a constant rather than just a number in an if test, but its not that bad to leave like it is.


A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
This implementation can easily support changes regarding the type of enemy that is spawned, the location of the spawner, and the amount of time that the spawner takes to spawn a new enemy once enabled. Overall very easy to maintain.
