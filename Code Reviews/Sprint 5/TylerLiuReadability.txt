Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
- Good use of variable naming, helps reader understand what the var stores without looking at documentation. (Self Explanatory)
- Separation of different variable initialization help organize and see what each section of the code does what
- Used int as a way to determine if current mode is Easy, Normal, or Hard
- Used boolean for the HordeMode gameplay mode
- One problem I noticed is the use of magic numbers for the rectangles
- Interesting to change the colors (toggling colors based on mode)
