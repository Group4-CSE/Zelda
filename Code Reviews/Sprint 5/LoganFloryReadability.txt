Sprint #5
Name of .cs being reviewed: StartMenuScreen.cs
Author of .cs being reviewed: Noah Hufnagel
Minutes taken to complete: 10
Specific Comments:
- Variable names are easy to follow
- Helper methods are really small and make code a lot easier to follow 
- There are a lot of magic numbers but that's kind of expected, maybe we could make global screen positional constants? That way 
  we could move stuff around without having to change a bunch of numbers
- Not sure why you're declaring stuff in the draw method instead of at the top (i.e. difficulty and color and diffValue, etc)
- Overall really straight forward to read and figure out what's going on
