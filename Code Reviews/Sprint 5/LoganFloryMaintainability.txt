Specific Comments:
- The code is a bit hard to read and find out where I'm at
- Using two methods for cheat codes and special moves is useful and would allow us to alter them separately 
- Storing the input keys as a stack is a really good idea
- Having 2 stacks of keys may be redundant
- The way you used a timer is a good addition 
- The giant if else would be a little bit difficult to maintain if we were to alter how input tracking was done 
Hypothetical Change:
- Overall I think the implementation is good because it also allows us to easily add more combinations of keys for cheat codes / special moves without 
  having to change anything big. A hypothetical change I thing would prove difficult with this implementation is if we let the player choose / if we 
  changed the assignment of keys used for things like movement or items, there could be conflicting keys, especially since they are hard coded, so maybe
  if we implemented some sort of data structure that told us what keys are in use instead and then based the special inputs off of those.
