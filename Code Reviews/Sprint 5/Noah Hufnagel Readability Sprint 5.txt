Specific comments:
This method is relatively well documented with comments.
Just from first glance I can easily tell which if tests are used
to determine which direction the enemy needs to move
most of the variables are self documenting(X,Y, enemyVel). playerRect is not as apparent but relatively self explanatory
playerOffset is a bit confusing for a variable name.
overall though this code is quite easy to read and process
