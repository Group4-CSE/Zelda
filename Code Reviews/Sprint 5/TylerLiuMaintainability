Specific comments on code quality:
Overall from first look, code looks clean and no code smell.
Its pretty short but concise to where it executes well.
It adds health to the player by updating the player's health.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current
implementation could or could not easily support that change:

You can add more or less health by changing the constants in the Execute() method.
